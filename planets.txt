Positives:

148 without KMT


Start with using current data, with a 230 positives, 270 negatives

Reach out to NASA, ask for how do i get more simulated data, or their real data in magnitude form.

Make a Model on simulating light curves first, Look at actual packages, 

Find highest y pos then grab their x and then splice it in a +/- 1000 to 1500 date
Make a new array, 

Add negative samples to my .csv files

Try multiple variations of the model

Aim for consistent size
