Positives:

48 From NASA, 100 From OGLE, 84 from KMT, but not in a good form.

232 total,
148 without KMT


Start with using current data, with a 230 positives, 270 negatives

Reach out to NASA, ask for how do i get more simulated data, or their real data in magnitude form.

Make a Model on simulating light curves first, Look at actual packages, 

Find highest y pos then grab their x and then splice it in a +/- 1000 to 1500 date
Make a new array, 

Add negative samples to my .csv files

Try multiple variations of the model

Aim for consistent size


FOr WFIRSt survey idx's with omcassan in their fields are exoplanets.  This gives 48 guarenteed samples
KMT has 84 samples
OGLE has 100, but I may not be able to use them. Current total, 232

omcassan

(ombin = Binary star, omcassan = Bound planet) 

Current DATA Samples 7/12/24:

100 OGLE Lightcurves, seeking permission rn

84 KMT Lightcurves, but I have multiple samples for each so in reality I have 300-400 KMT

96 WFIRST Lightcurves, confirmed

192 Extra WFIRST Lightcurves, may be repeating but doubt it. 

Low: 372

Low with OGLE: 472

Probable: 748 to 800 

Negative: 

196 Bianries, simulated,

50 OGLE, 

Then the remaining is KMT data, around 270 non exoplanet events. If i can find Binaries I will choose them. 



8 OGLE Binaries: 

OGLE-2006-BLG-238, OGLE-2007-BLG-159, 
OGLE-2007-BLG-491, OGLE-2008-BLG-143, OGLE-2008-BLG-210, 
OGLE-2006-BLG-215, OGLE-2006-BLG-450, and OGLE-2008-BLG-513.
